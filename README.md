by Mohammed Nowaz Rabbani Chowdhury, Shuai Zhang, Meng Wang, Sijia Liu and Pin-Yu Chen

### Requirements 
tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib

### Description
For experiments on each dataset, there is one directory. For example, for all the experiments on the CelebA  dataset, the directory is "CelebA Exp".

The data files need to be downloaded in the experiment directory using the hyperlinks provided at the file  ```data_files_*.txt``` of the directory.

The ```main_*.py``` in each folder train the networks and plot the results.
